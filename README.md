## AOC

This repositories contains all my solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) of each year in which I participated.
Since 2021 I added a little bit of a challange to the plain challanges, such that the problems are a little more difficult.

### Challanges:
 - **2021**: Use **a random language**. For generating the challange I used the `language.py` script also located in this repository. Possible languages were: `python, kotlin, java, rust, c, cpp, perl, haskell, ruby, js`
 - **2022**: This year I was learning **rust** so I tried to solve every challange in Rust. Exceptions were challanges that needed a recursive/self referential data structures. At the time I didn't know how to convince the borrow checker to allow them.
 - **2023**: Raising the difficulty a bit this year. I implemented **my own programming language** called `hh-lang`. I tried solving every puzzly in it. The interpreter can be found here: <https://github.com/KoKoKotlin/hh-lang>
